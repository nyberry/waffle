# ðŸ©º Clini â€” AI-Assisted Medical Report Generator

Clini is a Django web application designed to streamline the extraction of medical data from uploaded clinical documents (PDF) and generate clear, concise reports using AI.


## ðŸ©ºFeatures (version 1.1, April 15th 2025)

- User authentication (login, logout, register, confirm email, change password and profile details)
- Drag-and-drop file upload 
- Encryption of all uploaded data
- View and manage uploaded files per patient
- Cleans and anonymises data 
- Medical data extracted and organised using AI call #1
- Generates patient report using AI call #2
- Allows user to manually edit then download the final report 
- Optional password protection of report
 

## ðŸ©ºTech Stack

- **Backend:** Django 3.2
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI API
- **PDF Handling:** PyMuPDF, python-docx
- **Deployment:** PythonAnywhere




## ðŸ©º Distinctiveness and Complexity


>**ðŸ©ºDistinctiveness**

This app was designed for local use at a clinic in Doha, Qatar. The report generator accepts as input pdfs from laboratories or clinical software systems; text files; and image files. On one level, it can be used by anyone, but there are customisations such as stamps and letterheads specific to the organisation in which it is intended to be used intially.

> **ðŸ©ºComplexity**

This Django project contains seperate apps for user authentication, data upload, and report generation. There is also a core app containing templates and logic common to all the other apps.

- Within the user app, SMTP email integration allows verification of users identity.

- Within the upload app, uploaded files are encrypted before being stored in the database. The decrypt key is specific to each user, ensuring that there can be no breach of privacy.

- Within the reportgen app, plain text is extracted from the PDF files, and then anonymised. Using an AI API call, medical data is parsed from this anonymised text. This data is cleaned and organised, and passed to the AI API again, with prompts to generate a report.

- Within the core app, the user interface is structured as a single-page web application, with html components dynamically controlled using javascript modules and CSS.

## ðŸ©ºA list of every file created (required for CS50 project submission)

```
clini/

This is the main application directory containing the high level Django project files.â€‹ Within it, I have created the following files:

- README.md: Describes features, stack, and folder structure of the project.
- .gitignore Lists: files and folders to be ignored by Git
- requirements.txt:Lists all Python dependencies required to run the project

/core/

This is an application directory containing logic and templates which are core to all other applications.

- admin.py : Used to register any models from the core app with the Django admin interface.

- models.py : Used to define database models (empty, as no models are needed in core).
- tests.py :Contains unit tests for the app.
- urls.py : Defines URL routes for the core appâ€™s views.
- utils.py : Contains helper functions or shared logic used throughout the apps, including file encryption and decryption.
- views.py Defines views that handle HTTP requests and return responses (e.g., rendering templates like home or about pages).
